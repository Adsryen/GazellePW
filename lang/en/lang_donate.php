		<li>' . SITE_NAME . ' uses all voluntary donations to cover the costs of running the site, tracker, and IRC network. These costs represent the hardware the site runs on (e.g. servers, upgrades, fixes, etc.), and recurring operating expenses (e.g. hosting, bandwidth, power, etc.).</li>
		<li>When you donate you aren\'t paying the ' . SITE_NAME . ' Staff, purchasing upload credit, or buying the ability to download. No staff member or other individual responsible for the site\'s operation personally profits from user donations.</li>
		<li>Be reminded that when you make a donation, you aren\'t "purchasing" Donor Ranks, invites, or any ' . SITE_NAME . '-specific benefit.

Some of these perks are cosmetic (e.g. a donor icon added to your account), some are one-time benefits (e.g. additional invites), and others modify specific site options (e.g. additional profile information boxes, or personal collages).</li>
