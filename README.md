# GazellePW

GazellePW (GazellePosterWall) is a web framework geared towards private BitTorrent trackers. It's a **movie version** of Gazelle.

## Background

[WhatCD/Gazelle](https://github.com/WhatCD/Gazelle) is naturally focusing on music. OPSnet team also does some great things based on it, but Gazelle could be applied to more scenarios. We forked some versions of [OPSnet/Gazelle](https://github.com/OPSnet/Gazelle), added lots of features, and made cleanups. Now it works for movie sites. In addition, it also contributes to TV sites and even other sites.
