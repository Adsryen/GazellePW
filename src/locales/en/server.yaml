    Thank you for coming to donation page, your support will help ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}'s survival. If you are financially able, help pay ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}'s bills by donating. Before you donate, you need to know and confirm these things:
      <ol id="about_donation">
      <li>${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} is a nonprofit organization and not sponsored, and provides its services free of charge. Supporting ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} is and will always remain voluntary.</li>
      <li>${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} uses all voluntary donations to cover the costs of running the site, tracker, and IRC network. These costs represent the hardware the site runs on (e.g. servers, upgrades, fixes, etc.), and recurring operating expenses (e.g. hosting, bandwidth, power, etc.).</li>
      <li>When you donate you aren't paying the ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} Staff, purchasing upload credit, or buying the ability to download. No staff member or other individual responsible for the site's operation personally profits from user donations.</li>
      <li>Be reminded that when you make a donation, you aren't "purchasing" Donor Ranks, invites, or any ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}-specific benefit. And users cannot fetch their lost privileges (e.g. account locked, download privilege banned etc.) or accounts by donating. When donating, you are helping ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} pay its bills, and your donation should be made in this spirit.</li>
      <li>${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} forbid people to gain accounts by donation permanently. Any invite by trading is individual behavior. Any account comes from trading will cause buyer and seller's accounts banned and will not be recovered forever.</li>
      <li>${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}'s Donor Rank system is currently available to all credited donors. This system provides donors with perks. Some of these perks are cosmetic (e.g. a donor icon added to your account), some are one-time benefits (e.g. additional invites), and others modify specific site options (e.g. additional profile information boxes, or personal collages).</li>
    </ol>
  donation_info_10: |
    <strong class="u-colorWarning">Important explanation:</strong>
    <ul id="donate_explanation_body">
      <li>In order to be brief, every rank of donation only list the differences to the lower rank. The higher rank contains the rewards of lower rank.</li>
      <li>Only donate more than $15, you can get invites, and <strong>Only Power User+</strong> have the privilege to send invites.</li>
      <li>Each donor may get 6 invites in total. Donation after that will not bring you any invite.</li>
      <li>the upper limit of Donation Rank is 5 and will -1 per month. However the Total Donor Points (1 point = $7.5) will only increase. When Total Donor Points reach 50, your rank will not reduce any more.</li>
      <li>The reduction of Donation Rank will cause the unused additional personal collage drawback, but your invites will still be there.</li>
      <li>If you have any question, <strong>please</strong> send us a Staff PM to confirm before you donate.</li>
      <li>The ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} Staff does its best to recognize ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}'s financial supporters in a fair and fun way, but all Donor Perks are subject to change or cancellation at any time, without notice.</li>

  report_collage_guide_1: The report collage option is for reporting a collage which breaks one of the collage guidelines found on the <a href="rules.php?p=collages">collage rules page</a>.
  report_collage_guide_2: Collage rules are an interpreted concept, and it is up to staff to interpret these rules. If you feel like this collage might be a borderline case between allowed and not allowed, feel free to report it, and we will look into it.
  report_collage_guide_3: We encourage all users to use this feature whenever possible. This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
  report_collage_guide_4: In your report description below, please be specific and include as much information as possible that will help our staff resolve the issue.
  report_forum_thread_guide_1: |
    Please use the &quot;Report thread&quot; option in the following situations:
    <ul>
    <li>Reporting when <a href="rules.php?p=chat">chat rules</a> have been broken, such as posts containing racism, offensive language, flaming, pornography, and other rules violations. We encourage all users to use this feature when they see a rules violation of any form.</li>
    <li>Requesting that a thread be unlocked.</li>
    <li>Reporting threads that are in the wrong forum.</li>
    <li>Reporting answered questions in the Help forum.</li>
    </ul>
  report_forum_thread_guide_2: This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
  report_forum_thread_guide_3: Please restrict the use of this feature to reporting rules violations, and remember, this is for reporting threads, not replying to them.
  report_post_comment_guide_1: The report comment option is specifically for reporting when the <a href="rules.php?p=chat">chat rules</a> have been broken, such as posts containing racism, offensive language, flaming, pornography, and other rules violations.
  report_post_comment_guide_2: We encourage all users to use this feature when they see a rules violation of any form.
  report_post_comment_guide_3: This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
  report_post_comment_guide_4: Please restrict the use of this feature to reporting rules violations, and remember, this is for reporting comments, not replying to them.
  report_request_guide_1: The report request option is for reporting a request which breaks any of the rules found <a href="rules.php?p=requests">here</a> and for making minor, generally cosmetic, changes to a request (e.g. adding a poster, revising a to-be-announced movie title, etc.).
  report_request_guide_2: We encourage all users to use this feature whenever possible. This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
  report_request_guide_3: In your report description below, please be specific and include as much information as possible that will help our staff resolve the issue. Links to reliable, external sources of information are extremely useful when resolving reports. Examples of such sources include the company's official web site, <a href="https://imdb.com/">IMDb</a>, <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TMDB</a> and <a href="https://movie.douban.com/">Douban</a>.
  report_request_guide_4: <strong>Do not report requests simply because they are unfillable.</strong> Requests for currently unfillable releases are allowed because the request may become fillable in the future. An example of such a scenario would be a request for a physical media rip of a currently Amazon-only release because a physical media release could occur at some future date. The probability of such a physical release is not relevant.
  report_request_guide_5: <strong>If you are reporting this request to get it updated to the new requests system, please go back and click '[Request update]'</strong>.
  report_request_update_guide_1: This option is for asking the moderators to update your request to the new system.
  report_request_update_guide_2: If your request has no other votes, you can just edit it yourself!
  report_request_update_guide_3: If possible, please include a <a href="http://www.discogs.com">Discogs</a> or <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> link in the comments field.
  report_user_guide_1: The Report User option is for reporting a user who has broken one of the golden rules outlined <a href="rules.php">here</a>, or if you need to alert staff to something specific about a user that cannot be reported elsewhere.
  report_user_guide_2: We encourage all users to use this feature whenever possible. This will get quicker action than PMing a staff member will.
  report_user_guide_3: |
    Please do not report a user in this section for breaking rules such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Torrent uploads</li>
    <li>Forum threads/posts</li>
    <li>Collages</li>
    <li>Requests</li>
    </ul>
  report_user_guide_4: These have their own specific section for reporting, found on their respective pages.

  long_13: Accounts are for personal use only. Granting access to your account in any way (e.g., shared login details, external programs) is prohibited. <a href="wiki.php?action=article&name=invite">Invite</a> friends or direct them to our <a href="" . CONFIG['TG_GROUP'] . "" target='_blank'>official Telegram group</a>.
  long_14: You agree to log into the site regularly in order to keep your account in good standing. Failure to do so will result in your account being disabled. See <a href="wiki.php?action=article&id=11">Account Inactivity</a> for more information.
  long_21: You are responsible for your invitees. You will not be punished if your invitees fail to maintain required share ratios, but invitees who break golden rules will place your invite privileges and account at risk.
  long_22: |
    Only invite people you know and trust. Do not offer invites via other trackers, forums, social media, or other public locations. Responding to public invite requests is prohibited. Exception: Staff-designated recruiters may offer invites in approved locations.
  long_23: >-
    You may visit invite forum of ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} when you reach Power User and above. Some trackers only allow offical recruitment, their invites may not be offered or requested on the forums in other trackers. You need to read <a href="forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=15">Rules on Section of Requesting Invites</a> and <a href="forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=100">Do Not Request Invites List</a> before you request an invite. You may request invites by messaging users only when they have
    offered them in the Invites Forum. Unsolicited invite requests, even by private message, are prohibited.
  long_24: Do not mention "${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}" in any public area. And do not reveal our site url or tracker url. Please hide our Logo when you capturing a screenshot.
  long_31: Transferring buffer&mdash;or increasing your buffer&mdash;through unintended uses of the BitTorrent protocol or site features (e.g., <a href="rules.php?p=requests">request abuse</a>) constitutes ratio manipulation. When in doubt, send a <a href='staffpm.php'>Staff PM</a> asking for more information.
  long_32: Reporting incorrect data to the tracker constitutes cheating, whether it is accomplished through the use of a modified "cheat client" or through manipulation of an approved client.

  ratio: Ratio
  ratio_1: |
    <strong>1: Determine the maximum and minimum possible values of your required ratio.</strong> Using the table above, determine your amount downloaded bracket from the first column.
    Next, locate the values in the adjacent columns. The second column lists the maximum required ratio for each bracket, and the third column lists the minimum required ratio for each
    bracket. The maximum and minimum required ratios are also referred to as the <strong>0% seeded</strong> and <strong>100% seeded</strong> required ratios, respectively.
  ratio_2: |
    <strong>2: Determine the actual required ratio.</strong> Your actual required ratio will be a number that falls between the maximum and minimum required ratio values determined in the
    previous step. To determine your actual required ratio, the system first uses the maximum required ratio (0% seeded) and multiplies it by the value [1 &minus; (<var>seeding</var> / <var>snatched</var>)]. Formatted
    differently, the calculation performed by the system looks like this:
  ratio_3: |
    <strong>3: Round, if necessary.</strong> The value determined in the previous step is rounded up to your minimum required ratio (100% seeded) if necessary. This step is required because
    most amount downloaded brackets have a minimum required ratio (100% seeded) greater than zero, and the value returned by the above calculation is zero when seeding equals snatched.
  ratio_dl: Amount Downloaded
  ratio_dl_title: These units are actually in base 2, not base 10. For example, there are 1,024 MB in 1 GB.
  ratio_re_0: Required Ratio (0% seeded)
  ratio_re_100: Required Ratio (100% seeded)
  ratio_show: |
    In this formula, <var>snatched</var> is the number of non-deleted unique snatches you have made. If you snatch a torrent twice, it only counts once. If a snatched torrent is deleted from the site, it is not counted at all.</li>
    <li>In this formula, <var>seeding</var> is the average number of torrents you&apos;ve seeded over a 72 hour period within the last week. If you&apos;ve seeded a torrent for less than 72 hours within the last week, it will not raise your seeding total. Please note that while it is possible to seed more torrents than you have snatched, the system effectively caps the value at 100% of your snatched amount.</li>
  ratio_sum: |
    Required Ratio Calculation:
  ratio_summary_1: |
    Required Ratio Details:
  ratio_summary_1_con: |
    <li>If you stop seeding for one week, your required ratio will become the maximum required ratio (0% seeded) for your amount downloaded bracket. Once you have resumed seeding for a 72 hour period, your required ratio will decrease according to the above calculations.</li>
    <li>If your download total is less than 5 GB, you won&apos;t be eligible for ratio watch, and you will not need a required ratio. In this circumstance, your required ratio will be zero regardless of your seeding percentage.</li>
    <li>If your download total is less than 20 GB and you are seeding a number of torrents equal to 100% of your snatches, your required ratio will be zero.</li>
    <li>As your download total increases, your minimum (100% seeded) and maximum (0% seeded) required ratios taper together. After you have downloaded 100 GB, those values become equal to each other. This means that users with download totals greater than or equal to 100 GB have a minimum required ratio (100% seeded) of 0.60 from that point forward.</li>
  ratio_summary_2: |
    Required Ratio Example:
  ratio_summary_2_con: |
    <li>In this example, Rippy has downloaded 25 GB. Rippy falls into the 20&ndash;30 GB amount downloaded bracket in the table above. Rippy&apos;s maximum required ratio (0% seeded) is 0.30, and his minimum required ratio (100% seeded) is 0.05.</li>
    <li>In this example, Rippy has snatched 90 torrents, and is currently seeding 45 torrents.</li>
    <li>To calculate Rippy&apos;s actual required ratio, we take his maximum required ratio (0% seeded), which is 0.30, and multiply it by [1 &minus; (<var>seeding</var> / <var>snatched</var>)] (which is 0.50). Written out: <samp>0.30 * [1 &minus; (45 / 90)] = 0.15</samp></li>
    <li>The resulting required ratio is 0.15, which falls between the maximum required ratio of 0.30 and the minimum required ratio of 0.05 for his amount downloaded bracket.</li>
    <li>If Rippy&apos;s on-site required ratio was listed as a value greater than the calculated value, this would be because he hadn&apos;t seeded those 45 torrents for a 72 hour period in the last week. In this case, the system would not be counting all 45 torrents as seeded.</li>
  ratio_summary_3: |
    Ratio Watch Overview:
  ratio_summary_3_con: >-
    <li>Everyone gets to download their first 5 GB before ratio watch eligibility begins.</li> <li>If you&apos;ve downloaded more than 5 GB and your ratio does not meet or surpass your required ratio, you will be put on ratio watch and have <strong>two weeks</strong> to raise your ratio above your required ratio. </li> <li>If you download 10 GB while on ratio watch, your leeching privileges will automatically be disabled.</li> <li>If you fail to leave ratio watch within a two week period, you
    will lose leeching privileges. After losing leeching privileges, you will be unable to download more data. Your account will remain enabled. </li> <li>The ratio watch system is automated and cannot be interrupted by staff.</li>
  ratio_summary_4: |
    Leaving Ratio Watch:
  ratio_summary_4_con: |
    <li>To leave ratio watch, you must either raise your ratio by uploading more, or lower your required ratio by seeding more. Your ratio must be equal to or above your required ratio in order for ratio watch to end.</li>
    <li>If you fail to improve your ratio by the time ratio watch expires and lose leeching privileges, your required ratio will be temporarily set to the maximum possible requirement (as if 0% of snatched torrents were being seeded).</li>
    <li>After losing leeching privileges, in order to adjust the required ratio so that it reflects the actual number of torrents being seeded, you must seed for a combined 72 hours within a weeklong period. After 72 hours of seeding occur, the required ratio will update to reflect your current seeding total, just as it would for a leech-enabled user.</li>
    <li>Leeching privileges will be restored once your ratio has become greater than or equal to your required ratio.</li>
  ratio_summary_a: Your <strong>ratio</strong> is calculated by dividing the amount of data you&apos;ve uploaded by the amount of data you&apos;ve downloaded. You can view your ratio in the site header or in the &quot;stats&quot; section of your user profile.
  ratio_summary_a_a: Your required ratio represents the minimum ratio you must maintain to avoid ratio watch. You can view your required ratio in the site header after the word &quot;required&quot; or in the &quot;stats&quot; section of your user profile.
  ratio_summary_b: To maintain <strong>leeching privileges</strong>, your ratio must remain above a minimum value. This minimum value is your <strong>required ratio</strong>.
  ratio_summary_b_b: Your required ratio is unique; each person&apos;s required ratio is calculated for their account specifically.
  ratio_summary_c: If your ratio falls below your required ratio, you will be given two weeks to raise your ratio back above your required ratio. During this period, you are on <strong>ratio watch</strong>.
  ratio_summary_c_c: Your required ratio is calculated using (1) the total amount of data you&apos;ve downloaded and (2) the total number of torrents you&apos;re seeding. The seeding total is not limited to snatched torrents (completed downloads)&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the total includes, but is not limited to, your uploaded torrents.
  ratio_summary_d: If you fail to raise your ratio above your required ratio in the allotted time, your leeching privileges will be revoked. You will be unable to download more data. Your account will remain enabled.
  ratio_summary_d_d: The required ratio system lowers your required ratio when you seed a greater number of torrents. The more torrents you seed, the lower your required ratio will be. The lower your required ratio is, the less likely it is that you&apos;ll enter ratio watch.

  requests_summary: >
    <li><li>

    <strong>Do not make requests for torrents that break the rules.</strong> It is your responsibility that the request follows the rules. Otherwise,your request will be deleted, and you will not get your bounty back.</li>

    <li>Do not request multiple torrents in a single request. This means no requesting two movies (ie: I am looking for Casablanca and Fight Club) or requesting two torrents of the same movie (ie: I want a high definition rip and a 700MiB AVI) in one request.You may ask for multiple formats, but you cannot specify all of them.</li>

    <li><strong>Do not unfill requests for trivial reasons.</strong> If you did not specify in your request what you wanted (such as bitrates or a particular edition), do not unfill and later change the description. Do not unfill requests if you are unsure of what you are doing (e.g. the filled torrent may be a transcode, but you don't know how to tell). Ask for help from <a href="staff.php">first-line support or staff</a> in that case. You may unfill the request if the torrent does not fit your
    specifications stated clearly in the request.</li>

    <li><strong>All users must have an equal chance to fill a request.</strong> Trading upload credit is not allowed. Abusing the request system to exchange favors for other users is not tolerated. That includes making specific requests for certain users (whether explicitly named or not). Making requests for releases, and then unfilling so that one particular user can fill the request is not allowed. If reported, both the requester and user filling the request will receive a warning and lose the
    request bounty.</li>

    <li><strong>No manipulation of the requester for bounty.</strong> The bounty is a reward for helping other users&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it should not be a ransom. Any user who refuses to fill a request unless the bounty is increased will face harsh punishment.</li>

        "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>blu.ray</strong>   "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>eac3to</strong>   etc.
        are strictly forbidden. Remember that these tags will be used for other versions of the same movie.</li>
    <li>If you have questions about the dropdown box on <a href="upload.php" target="_blank">the torrent upload page</a>, please don't add the tag.</li>
  tags_summary_onupload: |
    <li>Tags should be comma-separated, and you should use a period (".") to separate
    words inside a tag. Such as "<strong class='u-colorSuccess'>hip.hop</strong>" or "<strong class='u-colorSuccess'>post.rock</strong>".</li>
    <li>There is a list of official tags you can select from the dropdown box above. We recommend adding more specific
        sub-genres manually, but it is fine to use only these official tags if you do not feel qualified to be more
        specific. <strong>Please note that the "<strong class='u-colorSuccess'>2000s</strong>" tag refers to music
            produced between 2000 and 2009.</strong></li>
    <li>Avoid abbreviations if at all possible. So instead of tagging an album as "<strong
            class='u-colorWarning'>alt.rock</strong>" or "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>prog</strong>   tag it as
        "<strong class='u-colorSuccess'>alternative.rock</strong>" or "<strong
            class='u-colorSuccess'>progressive.rock</strong>". Make sure that you use correct spelling.</li>
    <li>Do not add 'useless' tags, such as personal opinions or anything you specify elsewhere on the form. "<strong
            class='u-colorWarning'>seen.live</strong>   "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>awesome</strong>   "<strong
            class='u-colorWarning'>flac</strong>   etc. If an album contains live contents, you can tag it as "<strong
            class='u-colorSuccess'>live</strong>".</li>
    <li>Only tag information on the album itself&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<strong>not the individual release</strong>. Tags
        such as "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>v0</strong>   "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>eac</strong>  
        "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>vinyl</strong>   "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>from.what</strong>   etc.
        are strictly forbidden. Remember that these tags will be used for other versions of the same album.</li>
    <li>Do not use "<strong class='u-colorWarning'>hardcore</strong>" or "<strong
            class='u-colorWarning'>garage</strong>". These tags are too vague as both describe two wholly unrelated
        genres. Use "<strong class='u-colorSuccess'>hardcore.dance</strong>   "<strong
            class='u-colorSuccess'>hardcore.punk</strong>   "<strong
            class='u-colorSuccess'>garage.rock</strong>" or "<strong
            class='u-colorSuccess'>garage.house</strong>" instead.</li>

  upload_h54k_t: Trumpable Marks
  upload_h5k: Trumping
  upload_h61k: Don't upload things that you don't have full access to. You have to make sure that you can do anything to the torrents or content before you upload them no matter where they are (locally or on the seedbox).
  upload_h62k: Don't upload torrents that you don't plan to seed. We ask you to seed at least 48 hours in 2 weeks or until the ratio reach 1. This rule is also for uploaders, please read <a href='rules.php?p=ratio'>H&R Rules</a> for more information.
  upload_h63k: Seeding as long as you can. ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']} plan to be a library for all movies and all formats permanently. Longer seeding, better tracker. As a member of ${CONFIG['SITE_NAME']}, you need to be strict with yourself.
  upload_h64k: Consider your situation when uploading torrents. You may reduce your upload frequency if your net speed is slow. DO NOT limit your bandwidth deliberately.

  upload_introk_note: >
    <p>The uploading rules below are overwhelmingly long and detailed for a reason. The length is necessary to explain the rules clearly and thoroughly. A summary of each rule is in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold text</span> before the actual rule for easier reading. You may also find the corresponding rule sections in the <a href="#Index">Index</a>. The corresponding <a href="#">&uarr;</a> (move one level up) and <a href="#Index">rule section links</a> (move down into the document) help
    provide quick navigation.</p>

    <p>Before you upload anything, if you are still unsure of what a rule means, PLEASE ask your questions at any of the following points of site user support: <a href="staff.php">First-Line Support</a>, <a href="forums.php?action=viewforum&amp;forumid=16">the Help Forum</a>, or <a href="wiki.php?action=article&amp;name=IRC"><?=CONFIG['BOT_HELP_CHAN']?> on IRC</a>. Send a <a href="staffpm.php">Staff PM</a> addressed to staff if other support has directed you to a moderator or if support has been unhelpful
    in your particular case. If you find any dead or broken links in the upload rules, send a <a href="staffpm.php">Staff PM</a> addressed to staff, and include in your message the upload rule number (e.g. <a href="#r2.4.3">2.4.3</a>) and preferably the correct link to replace the broken one.</p>

  title_how_to_blockquote: |
    Please read upload rule <a href='rules.php?p=upload#h2.1' target='_blank'>2.1</a> for title naming. Here are some extra explanation.<br/><br/>
    <strong>Movie title</strong>: The English main title of the movie. Please notice that the title that auto filled may not be a normal one, which is a transliteration of the original language title. At this time, we strongly recommend you to use Standard English title, which can be found on:
    <ul>
        <li>Film poster;</li>
        <li>MDb's "Also known as" Illustration;</li>
        <li>If the torrent is an Encode, the file name may be a standard English title.</li>
    </ul>When you can't find a Standard English title by the ways above, then a transliteration is acceptable. For example, Chinese movie <i>The Wandering Earth</i> should not be named as <i>Liu Lang Di Qiu</i>.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Chinese title:</strong> Please enter the mainland China title. Titles used in Hong Kong or Taiwan province are not allowed.
