<H1 id="content">Upload Rules</H1>

<H2 id="introduction">Introduction</H2>

The uploading rules below are overwhelmingly long and detailed for a reason. The length is necessary to explain the rules clearly and thoroughly. A summary of each rule is in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold text</span> before the actual rule for easier reading. You may also find the corresponding rule sections in the [Index](#Index).

Before you upload anything, if you are still unsure of what a rule means, PLEASE ask your questions at any of the following points of site user support: [First-Line Support](staff.php), [the Help Forum](forums.php?action=viewforum&forumid=16), or [{props.BOT_HELP_CHAN} on IRC](wiki.php?action=article&name=IRC). Send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php) addressed to staff if other support has directed you to a moderator or if support has been unhelpful in your particular case. If you find any dead or broken links in the upload rules, send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php) addressed to staff, and include in your message the upload rule number (e.g. [2.4.3](#r2.4.3)) and preferably the correct link to replace the broken one.

The usual trumping order for HD and UHD uploads is: HDTV &lt; WEB | HD-DVD | Blu-ray.** If there is a wide gap in bitrate, Blu-ray and HD-DVD sources  torrents can trump TV and HDTV sources in the same slot without any comparison screenshots.</H4>

<H5 id="5.1.1.1">5.1.1.1. **This trumping order is usually suitable but the decision ultimately comes down to quality (e.g. a WEB encode will not be deleted if Blu-ray sources turn out to be inferior).**</H5>

<H4 id="6.1">6.1. Don't upload things that you don't have full access to. You have to make sure that you can do anything to the torrents or content before you upload them no matter where they are (locally or on the seedbox).</H4>

<H4 id="6.2">6.2. Don't upload torrents that you don't plan to seed. We ask you to seed at least 48 hours in 2 weeks or until the ratio reach 1. This rule is also for uploaders, please read [H&R Rules](rules.php?p=ratio) for more information.</H4>

<H4 id="6.3">6.3. Seeding as long as you can. {props.SITE_NAME} plan to be a library for all movies and all formats permanently. Longer seeding, better tracker. As a member of {props.SITE_NAME}, you need to be strict with yourself.</H4>

<H4 id="6.4">6.4 Consider your situation when uploading torrents. You may reduce your upload frequency if your net speed is slow. DO NOT limit your bandwidth deliberately.</H4>
