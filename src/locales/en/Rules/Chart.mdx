<H2 id="1">1. General Rules</H2>

1.1. If a staff member says stop and you continue, expect at least to be banned from the chatting room.

1.2. Obsessive annoyance — both to other users and staff — will not be tolerated. Don't comment others casually.

1.3. No advertising, spamming, abusing, discriminating, etc..

1.4. No prejudice, especially related to race, religion, politics, sexual preference, ethnic background, etc. It is highly suggested to avoid these subjects entirely.

1.5. Staff have the final decision.

<H2 id="2">2. Forums Rules</H2>

2.1. Read the rule of the forum before posting.

2.2. Do not post irrelevant thread. Invite threads posted on non-invite forums will cause a big trouble.

2.3. Do not obtain economic benefits through non-trading forum posts.

2.4. Do not inappropriately advertise your uploads.

2.5. Refrain from quoting excessively. When quoting someone, use only the portion of the quote that is absolutely necessary. This includes quoting pictures!

2.6. Mature content in posts must be properly tagged.
The correct format is as follows: `[mature=description] ...content... [/mature]`,
where "description" is a mandatory description of the post contents.
Misleading or inadequate descriptions will be penalized.
[PM Staff](/staff.php) first if you are not sure.

<H2 id="3">3. IRC Rules</H2>

3.1. Do not belittle or slander any other tracker on any occasion under the jurisdiction of {props.SITE_NAME}.

3.2. Everyone began from a greenhand. Please help new users patiently if possible.
